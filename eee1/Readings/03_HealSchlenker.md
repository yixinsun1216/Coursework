## Class Discussion

* Tax increase leads to scarcity rent drop, so production lasts longer. However, the total amount extracted remains the same. 
* Scarcity rent: This is the fundamental rule of an efficient resource extraction policy &rightarrow;Â  the marginal profits at each time period in discounted terms (or in present value) should be equalized over time. Their common level should be equal to the marginal opportunity cost of the limited stock constraint, that is to the marginal scarcity rent of the resource. This scarcity rent is also called the Hotelling scarcity rent
* Isoelastic demand function - change in price by 1 percent, then you have a change in demand by $\eta%$ 
  * Gold standard of demand function in EEE? 
  * Most economists think about marginal policies -> functional form issues become less important. 
  * One papers like this, what matters for long-run analysis is how does demand behave once you get closer and closer to the choke price. CES gets into more problem
* Is the Hotelling framework the most suited for this market? Obviously price of oil is not rising at rate of interest 
* What about the fact that having carbon in the air now is a lot different than having carbon in the air 50 years from now &rightarrow; isn't it enough to just push oil production down the line?
* Ryan - weird demand system. There's a kink in the demand curve when you hit R = \$250, at which point you get shocked and immediately consume 0 oil. The way to fix this is to have imperfect substitutability between oil and renewables. 
* Severin Borenstein has been on the soapbox about how we won't get a carbon tax. We should be investing a shitload of money into solar technology and export this technology like crazy. Jim Sallee is the last on the reading list and is work on political economy. 
  * Extraction path is different between carbon tax and investing in technology. Tax is a shift in demand curve, whereas technology moves the reserve price. In terms of cumulative extraction, paper states they are equivalent. 
* Pigouvian taxation - what's the source of marginal damage? This is compatible with Hotelling at the end of the day. 

## Canvas Summary

There is overwhelming support among economists for a carbon tax as an efficient and market-based method of controlling emissions in the face of climate change. Under the Pigouvian framework, a tax internalizes the external costs of fossil fuel combustion, promoting substitution away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy sources. However, the Hotelling framework emphasizes the impact of a tax on the intertemporal consumption of an exhaustible resource. Under this framework, when there is a choke price (i.e. the price of renewables), then all the resource will be consumed eventually, and the same amount of a resource is consumed overall. This paper incorporates these two frameworks to analyze the dynamic impacts of a carbon tax on overall emissions. 

The paper starts with models of increasing complexity to highlight the potential outcomes of carbon taxes. The first model has a fossil fuel selling in a competitive market with a marginal extraction cost. It is competing against a renewable resource that is a perfect substitute for the fossil fuel. In this simple set up, the authors find that the two energy sources are never used simultaneously, and the tax can have one of two effects. In the first case, it decreases consumption in every period, which pushes back the date when the entire stock of fuel is used up but does not impact the total amount of fossil fuel consumed. In the second case, no fuel is consumed at all because it is not profitable to do so in the initial period. 

The paper then adds the following different layers to this basic model:

* Imperfect substitutability between fossil fuel and renewables
* Adding a fixed cost of extracting the fossil fuel
* Allowing for multiple grades of fossil fuel that have different extraction costs
* Allowing for extraction-dependent costs, where extraction cost is a function of cumulative extraction to date

While these layers lead to some different effects of a carbon tax, the overarching results still hold that if the fossil fuel is used in one period, then it will be used until the stock runs out. The case of multiple grades of fossil fuel is the only that allows for the market to push out more costly fossil fuels, thereby leading to the elimination of some of the emissions. 

The paper also models a cap and trade system, where permits behave as an exhaustible resource. They show that while it does reduce emissions, it requires a steep permit price to reach this result, and the permit market is able to capture all the scarcity rents form the fossil fuel market. 

The paper then simulate the effect of a carbon tax on long-term oil consumption and prices. The paper focus on oil (rather than coal and natural gas) because (1) the effect of a carbon tax on oil is less clear since the oil market has large scarcity rents  and (2) is traded globally, making the Hotelling framework of one global market a realistic application. Through the numerical analysis, they find empirical support for their model, projecting that a $100 tax reduces emission only by 1.6%. They also translate this \$100 tax into a 1.5% welfare reduction 

Discussion: 

The theory section is written clearly, and the exposition of the different scenarios was very educational in thinking through how to add layers of complexity to a model. Focusing on the intuition, the paper gave a very compelling story about why it is important to challenge conventional notions of the impact of a carbon tax. 

I understand why the authors chose to focus on the oil market, especially since they cite that consuming all the oil has the potential to use up the entire carbon budget that is left to keep the world within 2 degrees Celsius. However, I finished the paper wishing I had some back of the envelope estimates on the impact of a carbon tax on the coal market. The paper's main point is that a carbon tax has two impacts: (1) delaying consumption of fossil fuel and (2) eliminating expensive fuels. It would be nice to have a more balanced story about the benefits of a carbon tax, rather than just the (albeit more economically interesting) story on the oil market.  

I also wonder what is a policy that is analogous to a "global carbon tax", since a carbon tax in even the US alone seems out of reach. The author discussed how cheaper renewables are equivalent to a carbon tax, so can we think of cross-country technology spillovers from Germany's investment in renewables as essentially a global carbon tax?
