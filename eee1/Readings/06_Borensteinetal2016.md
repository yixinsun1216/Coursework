* Projecting out to 2030, given emissions targets, what is the distribution of possible outcomes in terms of what carbon prices California might expect

* Graph is a cartoon version of actual model - what is the marginal cost of abatement?

  * A bunch of zero cost abatement from complementary measures like Renewable Portfolio Standard, solar incentives, etc 
  * Costless reshuffling: California says if we import stuff, it counts against our cap. Import power from Nevada and Arizona from solar etc, leaving less power for Nevada and Arizona. But it's costless for California

* Huge share of probability pass is way on the left, where carbon price is at price floor because demand for permits is lower than cost of abatement

* Also a chunk of probability that there's a bunch of high prices

* And a sliver of probability where economists think the market will behave

* Point is either there's huge uncertainty and costs and benefits, so floor price or floor ceiling is going to bind, and not somewhere in between. So we should think about cap and trade as basically a stochastic carbon price. Price volatility is going to be massive. 

* Marginal abatement curves are really steep. Annual quantity targets is not what we should do with carbon pricing, given that targets cause huge volatility. 

* Also we don't care about how much carbon is abated on a year to year basis, we care about entire stock.
