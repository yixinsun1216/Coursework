## Mar Cement Paper

* No one drives cement down the highway because it seizes up
* Fragmentation of cement firms means there's a lot of local market power 
* If you happen to be on an ocean, it's possible to ship cement over long distances. If you're on the west coast, you get competition from Asia
* Making cement makes a TON of CO2. Most CO2 intense sector except electricity 
* Paper thinks about regulating emissions from cement, but there's 2 big distortions
  1. Leakage coming in from China - model supply curve of exports from China
  2. Market power
* Take seriously the intuition behind Stephen Holland paper and apply it in a serious model, adding in dynamic oligopoly tools

### Results

Graph 1: Domestic Emissions

* Grandfathering: Unconditionally giving permits away, so they should not impact production incentives, except for when you exit
* Output: if you produce more tons of cement, you get more permits - kind of like intensity standard in that it gives you an incentive to increase your output
* BTA: Pigouvian taxation + tax on imports

Graph 2: Cement Prices

* Flip side of what we looked at in graph 1

Graph 3: Leakage Graph

* Ton of leakage with auctioning - emissions coming in from China
* Mitigate leakage a lot with output-based updating (what we saw in Holland paper)
* BTA explicitly gets at the leakage - even go negative is because they're modelling imperfect competition in the US market, PC in China, so there's an asymmetry there

Graph 4: Change in Welfare  

* Auction is worse than doing nothing
