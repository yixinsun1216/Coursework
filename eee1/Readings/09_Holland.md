**Paper Summary**

While the first-best policy instrument is a Pigouvian tax in a setting where there is complete regulation, what constitutes the "best" policy is ambiguous when there is incomplete regulation, or leakage. Leakage can occur for two reasons: (1) political jurisdiction is different from the area where environmental damages actually need to be regulated, and (2) some firms avoid regulation, either through regulatory capture or the high costs of regulating 100% of the emissions. This paper investigates what the conditions are such that an intensity standard can actually dominate the optimal Pigouvian tax, modelling outcomes in an environment where there is no leakage, and an environment where there is. 

To begin, the paper presents a model where the only market failure is the emissions externality. This leads to <u>Proposition 1:</u> without leakage, (1) an intensity standard coupled with a consumption tax can attain the efficient outcome (same as the optimal tax) and (2) an intensity standard alone cannot attain efficient (except in the unrealistic case of a perfectly inelastic demand). The intuition here is that the intensity standard causes an implicit output subsidy towards products with lower emissions, which is inefficient because it encourages more output. However, by adding a consumption tax on the output when there is an intensity standard, we can still reach the efficient outcome. 

Next, the paper moves into a setting where there is leakage. Now the model has one covered (regulated or domestic firm) and one uncovered (unregulated or foreign) firm with access to the same production technology. This leads to <u>proposition 2:</u> (i) if the charge on uncovered emissions equals the externality, then optimal emissions tax attains the first best, but the optimal intensity standard does not. (ii) If the charge on uncovered emissions is less than the tax, an intensity standard can dominate the second-best emissions. The intuition for when an intensity standard dominates is when the charge on uncovered emissions is a lot less than the marginal damages produced by the externality. 



**Discussion**

The author did a good job teeing us up with policy relevance (I appreciate a laundry list of intensity standards, which were a lot of acronyms that buzzed around me but never learned too much about), and intuition about what is happening behind intensity standards. The model section was very dense though, often losing me in the details. However, I appreciated that the paper derived its results generally and in parallel using a chosen functional form to  try to fix ideas. 

The paper provided good intuition that the intensity standard dominates when the uncovered emissions charge is a lot lower than the marginal damages, which I imagine is often the case in leakage issues. It would have been helpful to give some real world examples (even if stylized) of what this means. For example, oil companies are firms who are heavy polluters who also have a lot of political clout, and thus intensity standards are likely to be more effective since the uncovered emissions charge is not sufficient to cover marginal damages (is my intuition here right?). Compare this with a situation in which it is just that monitoring all firms are difficult, so perhaps who is covered or who is uncovered is exogenous. Generally, it would be interesting to compare two settings where your status as a covered or uncovered firm is endogenous versus exogenous. 









## Paper Notes

This paper investigates the efficiency of first and second best instruments in the presence of incomplete regulation (leakage). Leakage can occur for two reasons: (1) political jurisdiction may not be geographically consistent with the region that suffers environmental damages or the product market, (2) actors may use political clout to avoid regulation, or there are costs to expanding the regulated base to cover 100% of the emissions. 

The intuition for this paper is that environmental market mechanisms reduce emissions through both substitution and output effects. Intensity standards fail because although they induce an implicit emissions tax, they also induce an implicit output subsidy, leading to inefficiency consumption. With leakage, the intensity standard can dominate because output effects from an emissions tax may be offset by leakage. If supply of the unregulated sector is elastic enough and dirty enough, leakage from an emissions tax may even increase total emissions. An intensity standard can dominant since the implicit output subsidy can prevent leakage which might have occurred under an emissions tax. If an implicit output subsidy leads to too much consumption, this can be remedied with a consumption tax on the externality producing good. 

Intensity standards also have advantages for regulating externalities produced by firms with market power. Since the inefficiency from market power arises due to insufficient output, an intensity standard's implicit output subsidy may reduce the inefficiency of environmental regulation of firms with market power. 



## 2. Intensity standards in environmental regulation

### Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)

* adopted in 2007 in California to reduce CA's carbon emissions by regulating the carbon intensity of motor fuel 
* Defined emissions based on lifecycle analysis 
* Measured output as energy equivalent gallons of fuel 
* Instituted trading of "LCFS credits" - trading transforms LCFS into a market-level policy instead of a firm-level policy
* Effectively a CAFE standard for fuels

### RPS

* requires electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewables 
* Intensity standard regulating the nonrenewable intensity of electricity 
* 24 states + DC have RPSs requiring from 15-40% renewable power by various dates
* Most states allow trading and define output as MW (capacity) or MWh (production) of electricity 



### Renewable Fuels Standards (RFS)

* regulates share of "renewable" fuel in motor fuel
* National RFS was adopted as part of the Energy Policy ACt of 2005 and expanded in 2007
* RFS is similar to intensity standard because it requires each blender (e.g. Chevron)  to procure a specified percentage of renewable fuel, with trading allowed

### Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAAs)

* some regulations under CAAAs specify performance standards for new equipment 





## 3. Regulation with No Leakage

<u>Proposition 1:</u> without leakage, (1) an intensity standard couplde with a consumption tax can attain the efficient outcome (same as the optimal tax) and (2) an intensity standard alone cannot attain efficient (except in the unrealistic case of a perfectly inelastic demand)



## 4. Regulation with Leakage

Covered (regulated or domestic firm) and an uncovered (unregulated or foreign) firm with access to the save production technology. 

Show that neither emissions tax nor intensity standard will generally attain the first best, and either may dominate. 

<u>Proposition 2:</u> (i) if the uncovered emissions charge equals marginal damages, then optimal emissions tax attains the first best, but the optimal intensity standard does not. (ii) If the emissions charge is less than the tax, an intensity standard can dominate the second-best emissions. tax

<u>Corollary 1</u>: With a Cobb-Douglas production function and CRS, optimal intensity standards dominates second-best emissions tax if the uncovered emissions charge is low. Gives sufficient condition for an intensity standard to dominate the best emissions tax. Intuition is that intensity standard dominates if uncovered emissions charge is sufficiently below marginal damages

<u>Proposition 3:</u>  If $t_{U}<\tau,$ a combined intensity standard and consumption tax can dominate the second-best combination of an emissions tax and a consumption tax.
This proposition is not surprising given the result in Proposition $2 .$ However, the following corollary shows that an even stronger result can obtain, namely

<u>Corollary 2</u>. With Cobb-Douglas technology and constant returns to scale, a combined intensity standard and consumption tax attain the first best iff $t_{U} / \tau \geq(1-\beta)^{1 / \beta}$

With complete regulation, the intensity standard corrects the relative price of inputs, the consumption tax corrects the relative price of output, and the combined policy attains the first best. With incomplete regulation, the stringency of the intensity standard may be constrained by the marginal cost of the uncovered firm.
