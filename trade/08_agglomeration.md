## Economic Geography - Factors can move! Rosen-Roback Framework

* Fundamentally, spatial equilibrium is a no-arbitrage condition
* Benchmark model of spatial equilibrium is dubbed the "Rosen-Roback" model, due to the theory of equalizing differences (Rosen 19474) applied to cities for both workers and firms (Roback 1982)
* Goals:
  * How does change in amenity $s$ alter local prices (wages, rents)?
  * Infer the value of amenities
    * Debate about expanding population of US moving to Sunbelt. One story says people move there because as you get higher income, you care about quality of life. Another says housing regulation allows people to build stuff
* Markets
  * Labor: price $w,$ quantity $N$
  * Land: price $r,$ quantity $L=L^{w}+L^{p}$ for workers and production
    * One type of land, no downtown vs suburb
  * Goods: price $p=1,$ quantity $X$
    * Goods trade is totally uninteresting. No trade between cities because there's only one good. 
    * Spatial distance and costs don't matter. Doesn't matter that Chicago is close to Detroit etc
* Agents
  * Workers (homogenous, perfectly mobile)
  * Firm (perfectly competitive, CRS)
* Indifference conditions
  * Workers have same indirect utility in all locations
  * Firm has zero profit (i.e., unit costs equal 1)

Workers: Preferences and budget constraint

* Indirect utility is given
  $$
  V(w, r, s)=\max _{x, l^{c}} u\left(x, l^{c}, s\right) \text { s.t. } x+r l^{c}-w-I=0
  $$
* Let $\lambda=\lambda(w, r, s)$ be the marginal utility of a dollar of income, then
  $$
  \begin{array}{c}
  V_{w}=\lambda>0 \quad V_{r}=-\lambda l^{c}<0 \\
  \Rightarrow V_{r}=-V_{w} l^{c}
  \end{array}
  $$
  * $I$ is non-labor income that is independent of location (i.e. land gets divied up equally between everywhere)

**Equilibrium concept: two key indifference conditions**

* In equilibrium, workers and firms are indifferent across cities with
  different levels of $s$ and endogenously varying wages $w(s)$ and rents $r(s):$

$$
\begin{aligned}
c(w(s), r(s), s) &=1 \\
V(w(s), r(s), s) &=V^{0}
\end{aligned}
$$
â€‹		where $V^{0}$ is the equilibrium level of indirect utility.

* We will mainly be focusing on prices: $w(s)$ and $r(s)$ - can back out quantities if needed

**Effect of amenity changes on prices**

* If amenities are only valued by workers, then workers are willing to pay more in land rents and receive less in wages to have access to higher levels of amenities
* If amenities are only valued by firms, firms are willing to pay more in land rents and wages to access higher productivity due to amenities
* Firms don't use land nor value amenity
  * Wage equalization across space (because firms don't use land) and don't move with amenity
  * value of amenity is capitalized entirely in rents



## Agglomeration Economies

* People are concentrated. Industries are concentrated
* How do we identify productivity spillovers? 
  * Estimate directly: faces peer-effects problem
    * Common shocks vs selection vs actual peer effects? 
  * Infer from observed spatial equilibrium
  * Test for multiple equilibria

### Henderson (1974)

* Why do different cities exist?
  * Local increasing returns that are industry specific. "Localization economies"
* Annoying device: city developer to pin down uniqueness
  * City developer freely enters and makes no profit. Instead of ambiguous set of equilibria, the city developer does 2 things: (1) solve coordination problems so you get locally efficiently sized cities, (2) makes equilibrium unique
  * Distinction between self-organized equilibrium and city developer equilibrium persists
* Are cities too big or too small? Connection between stability argument and the fact that cities tend to be too large



## Productive cities: Sorting, selection, and agglomeration - BDRN

* Motivation I: spatial inequalities are ubiquitous 
* Motivation II: Urban premium
  * wages and productivity are increasing in city size
  * Cities attract the most talented people - result of heterogeneous agents
* Motivation III: Cities vary greatly in size. 
  * Rank-size rule: Zipfs law
  * This implies that in the case of cities, the second largest city is one-half the size of the first and the third largest city is one-third the size of the largest and so on.
  * Want to write down a model that gives Zips Law

* City equilibrium

  1. Proposition 1 (existence and selection). Given population, $L$, and its productivity distribution, $F(\cdot),$ the equilibrium in a city exists and is unique.

  2. Proposition 2 (agglomeration). Given $F_{d} \cdot$ ), larger cities have higher aggregate productivity, per-capita income, and wages than smaller cities. Productivity cutoff for selection does not depend on city size.
     Per-capita city income is
     $$
     \frac{Y}{L}=\left(\int_{\underline{\varphi}}^{+\infty} \varphi^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}} \mathrm{d} F(\varphi)\right)^{\varepsilon}\left(\int_{0}^{\underline{\varphi}} \varphi^{a} \mathrm{d} F(\varphi)\right) L^{\varepsilon}
     $$

* HOMEWORK IS ABOUT THIS PART!!!!



## Rosen/Roback Model - Glaeser Video

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMmXo1nHetE&feature=youtu.be&t=4085)

3 ingredients

1. Spatial equilibrium for workers/consumers who are mobile across cities. City can't deliver extra utility somewhere, because then people will flock to that area
2. Zero profit condition for firms and/or spatial equilibrium for entrepreneurs. More reasonable assumption than easy alternatives
3. Zero profit condition for the builders who supply housing, or producers who build the non-traded good

Added ingredients can include endogenous local policies determined by voting, endogenous agglomeration economies, endogeneous amenities

### Spatial Equilibrium for Consumer - Old Style

* Individual  $I$'s utility in place $c$ is $U_{i c}=V\left(Y_{c}, P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)$. There's only one type of person, choosing between cities

* $V(.,.,.)$ is an indirect utility function defined over local wages ($Y_c$), prices ($P_c$), and a vector of amenities ($\theta_c$)

  * $\theta$ stands for time spent commuting

* Utility must be equalized across space

* At any point in time the reservation utility or $\underline{U}$ must equal utility everywhere
  $$
  V\left(Y_{c}, P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)=\underline{U}
  $$

* Is this literally true? Self reported happiness across the US

  * Deep South is happier than Rust Belt. We see differences in happiness across the US
  * So spatial equilibrium is just an approximation

**What happens as amenities goes up?**

* What happens to income and prices? If we write this in terms of net income, $V\left(Y_{c}, P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)=V\left(Y_{c}-P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)$ then this equality implies that if an area's amenities improve
  $$
  \frac{d\left(Y_{c}-P_{c}\right)}{d \theta_{c}}=-\frac{V_{\theta}\left(Y_{c}-P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)}{V_{Y}\left(Y_{c}-P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)}
  $$
  * Higher amenities are associated with lower real incomes
  * First order thing to keep in mind - if something is nice about a place, then something else has to be BAD about the place. If a place has nice amenities, then you have to have lower real income

* Holding amenities constant: $d Y_{c}=d P_{c}$, any increase in price is offset by an equivalent increase in come; any incrase in income is offset by an equivalent increase in price &rightarrow; compensation differentials

  * Relationship between housing prices and income in data, by and large support this
  * 



### Spatial Equilibrium for Consumers - New Style

* See Rebecca Diamond's AER Paper

* Individual $I$'s utility in place $c$ is - no longer one type of consumer!
  $$
  U_{i c}=V\left(Y_{c}, P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)+\epsilon_{i c} / \rho
  $$

* $\epsilon_{i c}$ is a random place specific preference that follows a type 1 extreme value distribute with density $e^{-\epsilon-e^{-\epsilon}}$

* Individuals are identical except for their heterogeneous tastes for locations. Utilities are constant, subject to a location-specific idiosyncratic preference

* The share of the population living in city $\mathrm{c}^{\prime}$ is then
  $$
  \frac{\left.e^{\rho V\left(Y_{c}, P_{c}, \theta_{c} \prime\right.}\right)}{\sum_{c} e^{\rho V\left(Y_{c}, P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)}}
  $$
  * The $\rho$ term that scales the variance of the normalization of the variance of tastes is innocuous because the utility function can be redefined to accommodate any desired variance

* What's hard is heterogeneity in different types: different education levels, different tastes etc

### Free Entry Condition for Firms

* Production in the traded good is constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas
  $$
  \begin{array}{c}
  A_{c} L^{\alpha} K^{\beta} Z^{1-\alpha-\beta} \\
  A_{c}=\text {Local Productivy} \\
  \end{array}
  $$

* $A_c$ is endogenous in a simple agglomeration model, where it is typically a power function of total output, or total population. But we're not going to deal with that here

* $K$ is everywhere available at price of $r$

* $Z$ is non-traded capital, which has a fixed supply of $\bar{Z}_c$ in area $c$ - this is CRS technology. Still have profits which go to owner of the non-traded capital

* $L$ is hired at a local and endogenous price of $Y_c$ - determined by labor market 

* There is free entry for firms, price of traded good is normalized to 1

* Produces a local labor demand curve of 
  $$
  \ln \left(Y_{c}\right)=\Psi+\frac{1}{1-\beta} \ln \left(A_{c}\right)+\frac{1-\alpha-\beta}{1-\beta} \ln \left(\bar{Z}_{c}\right)-\frac{1-\alpha-\beta}{1-\beta}\left(L_{c}\right)
  $$

  * $\Psi$ is just a lot of constant terms that I don't want to carry around
  * The only truly fixed factor is the non-traded capital which makes local production function concave. These things are not city specific so they'll eventually vanish
  * This is one of 3 curves that will shape our equilibrium

* If we wanted to allow for agglomeration economies or other externalities, we would assume that 
  $$
  A_{c}=A_{0, c}\left(A_{c} L_{c}^{\infty} K_{c}^{\beta} \bar{Z}_{c}^{1-\alpha-\beta}\right)^{\gamma}
  $$

  * Individual firms are too small to internalize the impact of their output on agglomeration
  * This changes the parameters, but not the basic structure of the labor demand equation
  * This changes the parameters, but not the basic structure of the labor demand equation



### Zero Profit Condition for Non-traded Good (Housing)

* The non-traded good is produced with capital and non-traded capital M (land)
  * Not using labor to create housing
* This non-traded capital has a fixed supply of $\bar{M}_c$ which is determined both by local geography and by land use controls
* Typically we make one of two assumptions about this good
  1. It is power function for housing and consumption which is a Cobb Douglas utility
  2. Each good consumes exactly one unit of housing
* At this point, we need not specify
* If you wanted to use local labor to produce the good, you had better assume the Cobb Douglas structure
* Cobb-Douglas is a beautiful functional form, but it ties your hands because it ensures the income elasticities are one and the price elasticities of minus 1
* Sticking with the housing analogy, the supply of usable space is Height $\times$ Land, or HM
  * Capital cost of producing $H$ is $h_0H^{\delta_c}$ where we assume $\delta_c > 1$ 
  * In reality construction cost tells us that going from one story to five is quite convex, five stories to fifty is CRS, and more than 50 becomes convex again
  * Power function is easiest to work with 
* Housing supply differences are differences in $M_c$ or $\delta_c$) are important for explaining why cities look the way they do
  * If you think cities have relatively elastic supply (low $\delta_c$) - if you have rising demand, why some places would see more population and why some places you'd see higher prices. 

![image-20201108114618757](C:\Users\Yixin Sun\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20201108114618757.png)

* X-axis is new permiting / initial housing stock

  * Y-axis is gap between housing prices and physical cost of building. Places that build a lot aren't expensive, and places that are expensive don't build a lot. Compatible in view of heterogeneity in supply of housing. 
  * In Phoenix or Houston, demand shows up in change in quantity because of elasticity of supply. In San Francisco or LA it shows up in higher prices because quantity is more or less fixed. 

* This type of model can get at that, you just need different $\delta_c$

* Producers profits $=M\left(P_{c} H-h_{0} H^{\delta} c\right)-$ cost of $M$O

* Optimizing yields:
  $$
  H^{*}=\left(\frac{P_{c}}{\delta_{c} h_{0}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\delta_{c}-1}}
  $$

* Total supply of non-traded capital satisfies:
  $$
  H^{*} \bar{M}_{c}=\left(\frac{P_{c}}{\delta_{c} h_{0}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\delta_{c}-1}} \bar{M}_{c}
  $$

* To work with a system of city-specific equations, set $\delta_c = \delta$

### Individual Optimization within the City

* Return to microfounding the indirect utility function

* In all options, assume that amenities are just a multiplier: $\theta_c U(.)$. 2 options for this $U(.)$

  1. One household: turns off intensive demand for housing

     1. Utility is just $\theta_c U(\text{Trade consumption}) = \theta_cU(Y_c - P_c)$
     2. Not what we want given our other assumptions. Income is a power-function of labor supply; prices are a power function of labor supply. Subtracting two power functions isn't particularly pretty
     3. Generally, you want to arrange things so that you multiply power functions and add linear functions

  2. Cobb-Douglas Preferences: $\text { Utility }=\theta_{c} X_{\text {Traded}}^{1-\sigma} X_{\text {Non-Traded}}^{\sigma}$

     1. The price of the traded good is normalized to 1 .

     2. This implies an indirect utility function:
        $$
        V\left(Y_{c}, P_{c}, \theta_{c}\right)=\sigma^{\sigma}(1-\sigma)^{1-\sigma} \theta_{c} Y_{c} P_{c}^{-\sigma}
        $$

        1. Weight of housing price here depends on the share of your income that goes towards housing

     3. Spending on non-traded goods equals $\sigma Y_c$

* Equilibrium in the non-traded sector satisfies:
  $$
  P_{c}\left(\frac{P_{c}}{\delta_{c} h_{0}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\delta_{c}-1}} \bar{M}_{c}=L_{c} \sigma Y_{c}
  $$

* Remember $L_{c}$ is the endogenous number of workers, so we have two equations and three unknowns (housing price as a function of income and labor supply) and income as a function of labor supply.

  * $\ln \left(P_{c}\right)=\Omega+\frac{\delta-1}{\delta}\left(\ln \left(Y_{c}\right)+\ln \left(L_{c}\right)-\ln \left(\bar{M}_{c}\right)\right)$

* Adopting the notation 
  $$
  \ln \left(\tilde{A}_{c}\right)=\ln \left(A_{c}\right)+(1-\alpha-\beta) \ln \left(\bar{Z}_{c}\right)
  $$
* Then
  $$
  \ln \left(Y_{c}\right)=\Psi+\frac{1}{1-\beta} \ln \left(\tilde{A}_{c}\right)-\frac{1-\alpha-\beta}{1-\beta}\left(L_{c}\right)
  $$
  * Productivity minus number of people

* The third equation is the supply equilibrium equation that closes the system



SKIPPING MATH



### Results - Old Style

* Gives intuitive comparative statics
* Population is rising in productivity, amenities, and land supply
* Income is rising in productivity and falling in both amenities and land supply
* Prices are rising in productivity and amenities and declining in land
* Changes in population, income, and prices can be used to invert and solve for changes in amenities, productivity, and land supply
* Even though Sun belt is associated with rising population, it still doesn't have rising amenities - what's going on is Sun Belt areas (housing, dallas, phoenix) are areas that have radically boosted housing supply.
* If you see a place in which populations are going up, wages are not going up by a lot, and prices are going down a lot, that's got to be a shift in housing supply
  * Population is not going up, but prices and income are going up, something about productivity
  * Incomes are going down, population is going up and prices are going up, that's rising amenities 
  * Real wages are higher in the city, then amenities must be lower



### Results - New Style

* Migration terms moderate part of productivity in income and all of amenities in income. That is because productivity increases population which lowers wages and offsets the direct impact
* Big things are unchanged 
  * Productivity boosts prices, population and income
  * Amenities boosts prices and population but lowers income
  * Housing boosts population but lowers prices and incomes

### Summary

* People choose metropolitan areas and each one delivers a bundle of wages, amenities, and prices
* A simple linear model would be that for identical people, wages + amenities - pries is constant across the US
* This means that amenities can be measured as prices - wages
* If amenities attract people, then this measure should predict future urban growth
* If happiness tells us something about amenities, then happiness measure should work as well

## Henderson (1974) 

* Addresses basic, fundamental questions about a system of cities in general equilibrium
  * Why do cities exist? "beceause there are technological economies of scale in production or consumption"
  * Are cities too large or too small? "Stability argument says that cities tend to be too large"
  * Why do cities of different sizes exist? "cities of different types specialize in production of different traded goods"

### Environment

* Factors: land $L,$ labor $N,$ capital $K$
* Tradables production (external economies a la Chipman) 
  - Implicitly, there's an industry in city number 2

$$
X_{1}^{1-\rho_{1}}=L_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} K_{1}^{\beta_{1}} N_{1}^{\gamma_{1}} \quad \alpha_{1}+\beta_{1}+\gamma_{1}=1, \rho_{1} \in(0,1)
$$
- Housing production
  - Non-tradables called industry number 3
$$
X_{3}=L_{3}^{\alpha_{3}} K_{3}^{\beta_{3}} N_{3}^{\gamma_{3}} \quad \alpha_{3}+\beta_{3}+\gamma_{3}=1
$$
* Land sites produced by labor
  * Diminishing returns - congestion cost 
  * $z$ is a function of amount of labor in the city - worse as cities get more crowded 

$$
L=N_{0}^{1 /(1-z)} \quad z<0, z^{\prime}(N)<0
$$
- Clear factor markets with prices $p_{N}, p_{K}, p_{L}$
$$
N_{0}+N_{1}+N_{3}=N, \quad K_{1}+K_{3}=K, \quad L_{1}+L_{3}=L
$$
- Cobb-Douglas preferences $\left(U=x_{1}^{a} x_{2}^{b} x_{3}^{c}\right)$ with income $y,$ import of good 2 , and prices $q$ deliver indirect utility
  - $q$ are prices of goods
  - This is the indirect utility function

$$
U \propto y q_{1}^{-a} q_{2}^{-b} q_{3}^{-c}
$$

### Capitalists and Workers

* Different (stark) assumptions about capital ownership:
  * each laborer owns equal capital stock (Assumption A)
  * capital owners live outside of cities (Assumption B) - won't bid up the housing price
* Utility components for labor income and capital income
$$
\begin{array}{l}
U_{N} \propto p_{N} q_{1}^{-a} q_{2}^{-b} q_{3}^{-c} \\
U_{K} \propto \bar{p}_{K} \frac{\bar{K}}{N} q_{1}^{-a} q_{2}^{-b} q_{3}^{-c}
\end{array}
$$
<u>Solving for optimal and equilibrium city sizes</u> 

* Optimum: maximize $U_{N}+U_{K},$ given the determination of $U_{N}$, $U_{K},$ and $p_{K}$ through simultaneous location and investment of labor and capital in cities in the economy 
* Equilibrium: atomistic choices of capital owners, firms, and laborers

### Results

![image-20201108130142375](C:\Users\Yixin Sun\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20201108130142375.png)

- Vertical axis is utility levels and price levels. Horizontal axis is N
- $\alpha_{1}>\rho_{1}$ (site intensity vs IRS) is sufficient for both $p_{K}$ and $U_{N}$ to exhibit interior maxima
- $p_{K}$ curve has peak to right of $U_{N}$ and $U_{K}$ peak because  $U_{K}$ is  $p_{K}$ deflated by $q_{3}^{-c}$
  - Capital is translated to utility but deflated by price of housing
- Assumption B curves peak to right of Assumption A curves because capitalist income doesn't bid up housing prices
  - Now housing prices don't rise with increase in population so quickly because capitalist take income and don't spend it in local housing markets
- Why isn't "two identical cities at point C " stable? 
  - You're on a rising portion of the curve at C. If you nudge to city 1. That slight difference in population size means utility is higher in city 1, so more people will leave city 2 to go to city 1. So the fact that we're on the portion of the curve where we have rising utility with rising population means that the difference between city 1 and 2 grow with the nudge

### Optimal city size

* For Assumption A, maximize the vertical sum of $U_{N}$ and $U_{K}$
* Planner has total population $N$ and faces integer constraint 
* Start second city when $N$ is twice $N\left(U_{N}^{*}, U_{K}^{*}\right)$ (Starting second city earlier is not a stable optimum, as seen in the last slide)
* Figure 3 is more complicated due to Assumption $\mathrm{B}$ and the worker vs capitalist disagreement on optimal city size

### Equilibrium City Size

* Suppose city gets so big you're at $N(E)$. Then you could take a small number of people and deviate. 
  * Once a second city starts, you're on the rising portion, until we jump to half of $N(E)$ - we need utility equalization across cities
* Sizes are going to be too big - in order to be stable, you have to be to the right of $N(U_N)$. Someone joining the city is not internalizing their effect of driving up the driving congestion cost. If you are to the left of $N(U_N)$ then people will keep joining
* BDRN (2014): "there is a coordination failure in city formation so that any population size between optimal city size and grossly oversized cities - leaving their residents with zero consumption - can occur in equilibrium"

### Heterogeneous Cities

* "Our second type of city specializes in the production of another type of traded good, say, $X_{2} . "$
* "Different types of cities differ in size because production parameters, in particular $\alpha_{i}$ and $\rho_{i},$ differ between the traded goods of each type of city."
* "Although utility levels will be equalized between cities, wage rates and housing prices will vary with city type and size."

## Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, and Wolf

### TLDR

* Central challenge in economic geography: distinguishing agglomeration and dispersion forces from variation in locational fundamentals. 
* Empirical challenge: finding exogenous sources of variation in surrounding concentration of economic activity to help disentangle agglomeration and dispersion forces from variation in locational fundamentals 
* Berlin wall diff in diff:
  * Division leads to reorientation of the gradient in land prices and employment in West Berlin away from the main pre-war concentration of economic activity in East Berlin
  * Reunification leads to reemergence of this gradient 
  * Show that these results are not driven by pre-trends prior to division or reunification
  * Show that these results are roust to controlling for a host of observable block characteristics
* Then examine whether the model can account quantitatively for the observed impact of division and reunification
  * Model implies a gravity equation for commuting flows, which can be used to estimates its commuting parameters
  * Using these estimates, determine overall measure of productivity, amenities, and density of development for each block
  * Show that the model with exogenous productivity and amenities is unable to account quantitatively for the observed impact of division and reunification on the pattern of economic activity within West Berlin
* Next use the exogenous variation from Berlin's division and reunification to structurally estimate both the agglomeration and commuting parameters. 
  * ID assumption: changes in structural residuals are uncorrelated with exogenous change in the surrounding concentration of economic activity induced by Berlin's division and reunification
  * ID requires systematic change in pattern of economic activity in West Berlin following division and reunification is explained by the mechanisms of the model (changes in commuting access and production and residential externalities) rather than by systematic changes in pattern of structural residuals (production and residential fundamentals)
  * **Obviously this is violated in the Katrina case**. Katrina literally changes the the geographic features of New Orleans - how quickly did they rebuild the levees?



## Main Equations from Theoretical Sections

### 3.4 General Eqm With Exogenous Location Characteristics

GE determined by 7 equations:

1. <u>Population Mobility</u>: expected utility from moving to the city is equal to the reservation level of utility in the wider economy
   $$
   \mathbb{E}[u]=\gamma\left[\sum_{r=1}^{s} \sum_{s=1}^{S} T_{r} E_{s}\left(d_{r s} Q_{r}^{1-\beta}\right)^{-\varepsilon}\left(B_{r} w_{s}\right)^{\varepsilon}\right]^{1 / \varepsilon}=\bar{U}
   $$
   

2. <u>Residential Choice Probability</u>:
   $$
   \pi_{R i}=\sum_{j=1}^{S} \pi_{i j}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{S} \Phi_{i j}}{\Phi}
   $$
   

3. <u>Workplace Choice Probability</u>
   $$
   \pi_{M j}=\sum_{i=1}^{s} \pi_{i j}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{S} \Phi_{i j}}{\Phi}
   $$
   

4. <u>Residential Land Market Clearing:</u> demand for residential floor space equals the supply of floor space allocated to residential use in each location, $(1-\theta_i)L_i$. $H$ is population
   $$
   \mathbb{E}\left[\ell_{i}\right] H_{R i}=(1-\beta) \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[w_{s} \mid i\right] H_{R i}}{Q_{i}}=\left(1-\theta_{i}\right) L_{i}
   $$
   

5. <u>Commercial Land Market Clearing:</u> demand for commercial floor space equals the supply of floor space allocated to commercial use in each location, $\theta_jL_j$
   $$
   \left(\frac{(1-\alpha) A_{j}}{q_{j}}\right)^{1 / \alpha} H_{M j}=\theta_{j} L_{j}
   $$
   

6. <u>Profit max + zero profit</u>: equilibrium floor prices, $q_j$ in each block with positive employment must satisfy 
   $$
   q_{j}=(1-\alpha)\left(\frac{\alpha}{w_{j}}\right)^{\alpha /(1-\alpha)} A_{j}^{1 /(1-\alpha)}
   $$
   

7. <u>No arbitrage</u>: $\theta_i$ is share of floor spaced used commercial. $\xi_{i} \geq 1$ captures one plus the tax equivalent of land use regulations that restrict commercial land use relative to residential land use

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\theta_{i}=1 \quad \text { if } \quad q_{i}>\xi_{i} Q_{i} \\
\theta_{i} \in[0,1] \quad \text { if } \quad q_{i}=\xi_{i} Q_{i} \\
\theta_{i}=0 \quad \text { if } \quad q_{i}<\xi_{i} Q_{i}
\end{array}
$$



In this case, there are no agglomeration forces, and hence the model's congestion forces of commuting costs and an inelastic supply of land ensure the existence of a unique equilibrium. 



### 3.5 Introducing Agglomeration Forces

1. Production externalities
   $$
   A_{j}=a_{j} Y_{j}^{\lambda}, \quad Y_{j} \equiv \sum_{s=1}^{S} e^{-\delta \tau_{j s}}\left(\frac{H_{M s}}{K_{s}}\right)
   $$

   * Allow final goods productivity to depend on production fundamentals $\left(a_{j}\right)$ and production externalities $\left(Y_{j}\right) .$ 
     * Production fundamentals capture features of physical geography that make a location more or less productive independently of the surrounding density of economic activity (access to natural water). 
     * Production externalities impose structure on how the productivity of a given block is affected by the characteristics of other blocks
   * $H_{M s} / K_{s}$ is workplace employment density per unit of land area
   * Production externalities decline with travel time $\left(\tau_{j s}\right)$ through the iceberg factor $e^{-\delta \tau_{j s}} \in(0,1]$
   * $\delta$ determines their rate of spatial decay
   * $\lambda$ controls relative importance in determining overall productivity

2. Residential Amenities
   $$
   B_{i}=b_{i} \Omega_{i}^{\eta}, \quad \Omega_{i} \equiv \sum_{r=1}^{S} e^{-\rho \tau_{i r}}\left(\frac{H_{R r}}{K_{r}}\right)
   $$

   * Allow residential amenities to depend on residential fundamentals ($b_i$) and residential externalities ($\Omega_i$).
     * Residential fundamentals capture features of physical geography that make a location a more or less attractive place to live independently of the surrounding density of economic activity (e.g., green areas).
     * Residential externalities again impose structure on how the amenities in a given block are affected by the characteristics of other blocks
   * $H_{R r} / K_{r}$ is residence employment density per unit of land area
   * Residential externalities decline with travel time ($\tau_{ir}$) through the iceberg factor $e^{-\rho \tau_{i r}} \in(0,1]$
   * $\rho$ determines their rate of spatial decay
   * $\eta$  controls their relative importance in overall residential amenities. Captures the net effect of residence employment density on amenities, including negative spillovers such as air pollution and crime, and positive externalities through the availability of urban amenities





### 5 Reduced Form Results

**Evolution of Land Price Gradient Over Time**

**Difference-in-Difference Estimates**
$$
\Delta \ln O_{i}=\alpha+\sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbb{I}_{i k} \beta_{k}+\ln M_{i} \gamma+u_{i}
$$

* $\mathbb{I}_{i k}$ is an indicator variable for whether block $i$ lies within a distance grid cell $k$ from the pre-war CBD
  * $\beta_{k}$ are coefficients to be estimated
  * $M_{i}$ are time-invariant observable block characteristics (such as proximity to parks and lakes
  * $\gamma$ captures changes over time in the premium to these time-invariant
  * **$M$ is probably not time invariant in our case in terms of schools and parks?** Maybe just include this in our writeup
* Begin by considering distance grid cells of 500 meter intervals. Include grid cells for blocks with distances up to 3.25-3.75 kilometers. So the excluded category is blocks more than 3.75km from the pre-war CBD

* (1)-(5) is log difference in price of floor space. From (1) on average, West Berlin blocks within the first grid cell experience around a 55% reduction in the price of floor space between 1936 and 1986 ($1-e^{-0.800}=0.55$) relative to those more than 3.75 kilometers away from the pre-war CBD
* Reduced-form regressions do not distinguish between different explanations for why access to the pre-war CBD matters, such as loss of access to employment opportunities, production externalities, and/or residential externalities
* (5) includes controls - they are potentially endogenous to division, but the** consistent results show that the result is not driven by the controls**
* Analogous results for employment
* Figure 3 displays the log difference in land prices from 1936 to 1986 for each block. Show the largest declines in land prices following division and largest increases in land prices following reunification are along those segments of the Berlin Wall around the pre-war CBD 
  * Shows that it is not proximity to the Berlin Wall per se that matters, but the loss of access to the pre-war CBD 
  * **Want to replicate these figures for our paper, with housing and rental rates** - so we have one set of graphs that uses raw distances to Katrina on the x-axis, then another set of graphs that use some sort of weighted distance to Katrina
  * **If we have time, also try to rule out pre-trends using earlier ACS data**



### 6 Gravity, Productivity, and Amenities

Recover productivity, amenities, and density of development just using the model's gravity equation predictions for commuting flows

**6.1 Gravity**
$$
\pi_{i j}=\frac{T_{i} E_{j}\left(d_{i j} Q_{i}^{1-\beta}\right)^{-\varepsilon}\left(B_{i} w_{j}\right)^{\varepsilon}}{\sum_{r=1}^{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} T_{r} E_{s}\left(d_{r s} Q_{r}^{1-\beta}\right)^{-\varepsilon}\left(B_{r} w_{s}\right)^{\varepsilon}} \equiv \frac{\Phi_{i j}}{\Phi} \tag{4}
$$
From (4), we can get a reduced form version of the gravity equation
$$
\ln \pi_{i j}=-\nu \tau_{i j}+\vartheta_{i}+s_{j}
$$

* where the residence fixed effects $\left(\vartheta_{i}\right)$ capture residence characteristics $\left\{B_{i}, T_{i}, Q_{i}\right\}$ 
* the workplace fixed effects $\left(s_{j}\right)$ capture workplace characteristics $\left\{w_{j}, E_{j}\right\}$
* the denominator in (4) is a constant that is absorbed into the fixed effects
* commuting costs are $d_{i j}=e^{\kappa \tau_{i j}}$
* Travel times $\tau_{i j}$ are measured in minutes
* $\nu=\varepsilon \kappa$ is the semi-elasticity of commuting flows with respect to travel times and is a combination of the commuting cost parameter $\kappa$ and the commuting heterogeneity parameter $\varepsilon$
* Across a range of different specifications, they find a precisely estimated value of $\nu = \varepsilon\kappa$ of around 0.07
* Figure 4: regress both log bilateral commuting probabilities and travel times on workplace and residence fixed effects and graph residuals from these two regressions against one another - see that there's an approximately linear relationship between the two residuals

Using the estimate for $\nu = 0.07$ and transforming wages, we can solve for the transformed wage using
$$
H_{M j t}=\sum_{i=1}^{S} \frac{\omega_{j t} / e^{\nu \tau_{i j t}}}{\sum_{s=1}^{S} \omega_{s t} / e^{\nu \tau_{i s t}}} H_{R i t}
$$


**6.2 Productivity and Amenities**

Use the gravity equation estimation to recover overall adjusted productivity, amenities, and the density of development, we can use the profit max and zero profits (12) to find the log adjusted final goods and productivity relative to its geometric mean
$$
\ln \left(\frac{\tilde{A}_{i t}}{\tilde{A}_{t}}\right)=(1-\alpha) \ln \left(\frac{\mathbb{Q}_{i t}}{\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{t}}\right)+\frac{\alpha}{\varepsilon} \ln \left(\frac{\omega_{i t}}{\bar{\omega}_{t}}\right)
$$
where $\overline{\tilde{A}}_{t}= \exp \left\{\frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \ln \tilde{A}_{s t}\right\}$

From residential choice probabilities (5) and population mobility with the larger economy (9), log residential amenities relative to their geometric mean are
$$
\ln \left(\frac{\tilde{B}_{i t}}{\tilde{B}_{t}}\right)=\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \ln \left(\frac{H_{R i t}}{\bar{H}_{R t}}\right)+(1-\beta) \ln \left(\frac{\mathbb{Q}_{i t}}{\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{t}}\right)-\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \ln \left(\frac{W_{i t}}{\bar{W}_{t}}\right)
$$
where $W_{i t}=\sum_{s=1}^{S} \omega_{s t} / e^{v \tau_{i s t}}, \quad \omega_{s t}=\tilde{w}_{s t}^{\varepsilon}=E_{s t} w_{s t}^{\varepsilon}$

Set parameters according to existing literature:

* $1-\beta = 0.25$ &rightarrow; share of consumer expenditure on residential floor space
* $1-\alpha=.2$ &rightarrow; share of firm expenditure on commercial floor space
* $1-\mu=.25$ &rightarrow;Â share of land in construction costs

We have $\sigma_{\ln \tilde{w}_{i t}}^{2}=(1 / \varepsilon)^{2} \sigma_{\ln \omega_{i t}}^{2}$ so choose $\varepsilon$ to minimize the squared difference between the variance across districts of log adjusted wages in the model and log wages in the data, which yields $\varepsilon = 6.83$. This means $\kappa = 0.01$ 



**Lecture Notes**

* $\nu$ reported twice - section 6 it's .07, and then .1 in section 7
* Paper is mixing formal model and exogenous variation
* Tim Kehoe has been very good at evaluating trade models



## Empirical Examination

* Davis, Gregory (2020) - Placed Based Redistribution in Simple Location Choice Models
  * Frechet vs Weibull: marginal utilities can differ even when allocations and elasticities for marginal households coincide, thus making the problems differ even when positive predictions coincide

**Spatial Economics for Granular Setting**

* 3 ingredients: productivities, amenities, and transportation costs
* Spatial linkages govern the incidence of local economic shocks
* Want "empirically relevant quantitative model to perform general equilibrium counterfactual policy exercises"
