# Spatial Sorting of Skills and Sectors

Why should we care about the spatial distribution of skills and sectors?

1. They vary a lot
2. They covary with city characteristics
3. They're often the basis for identification
4. They should help us understand how cities work

Policy Motivation?

* All kinds of stuff that looks like place based policies (rent-control, zoning, etc) that you might think are important, and may or may not be optimal policies
* One example: coastal cities housing supply restrictions are holding back aggregate US GDP
